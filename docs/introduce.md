# Cooker 

Mock API is a technique that replaces real API responses with simulated data. During development, front-end developers often rely on back-end APIs, but these APIs may still be under development. With Mock API, the front end does not need to wait for the back-end API to be completed. Instead, it can use simulated data returned by the Mock API for development.

## Cooker’s Vision

**FOR** front-end developers and product owners working in agile development models.

**WHO** needs a simple way to develop, test, and showcase applications without depending on fully implemented backend APIs.

**The Cooker** is an API mocking tool. **THAT** Provides seamless local API mocking, scenario switching, and high-fidelity prototype delivery during development.

**UNLIKE** Swagger or Postman, which focus on API documentation and testing but lack integrated features for mocking and progressive delivery in agile workflows.

**OUR PRODUCT** offers integrated scenario configuration, multi-API state management, and a local-first, developer-friendly solution that reduces the dependency on backend teams and accelerates MVP delivery.

> Cooker’s design not only addresses the synchronization challenges between front-end and back-end development but also provides a powerful support tool for delivering product prototypes. By emphasizing local-first functionality, flexible scenario configurations, and progressive development principles, Cooker enhances both efficiency and flexibility in agile workflows. It is particularly well-suited for modern front-end and back-end decoupled development models.
